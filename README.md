# ðŸŽ² Triggle AI â€“ Console-Based Python Game

A console-based implementation of the board game **Triggle**, where a human player competes against an AI opponent powered by the **Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning**. The game is designed to be both strategic and fun, showcasing AI decision-making in a turn-based setting.

## ðŸ§  Game Overview

Triggle is a triangular grid-based board game. Each move is defined by a direction:
- `d` â€“ right  
- `dd` â€“ down-right  
- `dl` â€“ down-left  

The goal is to control strategic positions and outmaneuver your opponentâ€”whether you're the human or the algorithm!
